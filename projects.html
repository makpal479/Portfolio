            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>Game character model. <br>The 3D model of the girl was created in Blender using sculpting and manual retopology for optimal deformation during animation. The topology is simplified, with correct loops for facial expressions. The hair is made with geometric strands, and the eyes use PBR shaders for realistic highlights. The UV unfolding is optimized, the materials include normal and roughness maps. Prepared for rigging, with support for shape keys and constraints. Suitable for animation and rendering.</p>

            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p>Production pump model <br>The 3D model of an industrial pump was created in Blender with precise **geometry** and optimized **topology** for visualization and technical animation. **Hard-surface modeling** techniques were used, including Boolean operations and subdivision for clean details. The **topology** consists of evenly distributed quads to avoid artifacts. **PBR materials** with normal and metallic maps enhance realism. The **UV unwrapping** is optimized for technical labels. The model is prepared for rendering and mechanical simulation.</p>

            <h3>Project 3</h3>
            <p>Game character model. <br>2D anime stylized 3D model created in Blender with an emphasis on clean topology and optimization for cel-shading rendering. Retopology is simplified, with an emphasis on smooth loops for facial expressions. Hair consists of geometric strands with minimal detail. Materials use flat shader with hand-painted textures or toon shading. Eyes are painted on UV texture or created with shaders. Prepared for animation with shape keys and bone rig.</p>
